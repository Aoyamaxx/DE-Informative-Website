# DE-Informative-Website

Building and informative website using HTML and CSS, data processing done by Python.

The purpose of this website is to visualize the data by analyzing the public database of Annual Surface Temperature Change created by climatedata.imf.org to present and bring attention to the current problem of declining groundwater levels in Africa due to rising temperatures.

The website will visualize surface temperature trends globally and in 224 countries specifically, using the data to communicate the facts of global warming. At the same time, the website also disseminates BluePump as a potential temporary solution for Africa water problem.

Important: All graphs are pre-generated via exucuting data_analysis.py, footers and headers will be loaded into each HTML page via loadHeaderFooter.js.
